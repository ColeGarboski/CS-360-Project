# CS-360-Project



    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was designed to be a simple inventory management app for use by either personal collectors or by those working in a warehouse professionally to manage current stock. This should serve both types of users equally.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app needed to have user accounts and authentication, the ability to add or delete items from the database inventory, and the ability to receive updates over SMS when an item is out of stock. The UI is designed to be simple so that all users are able to use the app effectively and all features are accessible across multiple types of Android devices.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

When coding the app, I broke the app down feature by feature and implemented the UI for each feature first, then added in all of the functionality after. This technique allowed me to iterate quickly on the UI designs without needing to worry about functionalities changing or breaking existing code.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

When testing my code, I used a variety of methods. When testing inputs, I tried inputting many different types of invalid characters or datatypes that were not excepted. When testing the UI flow, I tried repeatedly to break it by going forward and back on pages, or creating an account after successfully logging in for example. This process is important because it can reveal the most common bugs that users will run into and it ensures that the app will be much more stable.
    
    Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    
When I was designing the grid layout for the main screen that shows the inventory items from the database, I needed to come up with a way to make the layout look good on multiple types of devices. This was my first time creating a proper responsive layout and I was able to come up with a way to make the layout grow and shrink to look good on many sizes of Android device.
    
    In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I always think user authentication is a good showcase of any developers skills. The ability to sign in and create accounts requires a database setup that can be interacted with quickly. And, due to the fact that most apps have login functionality, creating the UI for the forms to handle accounts leaves a lot of room for innovation or to show off mastery in the area of development.
